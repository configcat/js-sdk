## Steps to deploy manually

2. Run tests
   ```bash
    npm test
    ```

3. Create a new version (patch, minor, major)
Increase version number by using `npm version patch | minor | major`

    *Example: increasing patch version* 
    ```bash
    npm version patch
    ```
1. Push tag to remote
    
    If you tag the commit, a GitHub action automatically publishes the package to NPM. 
    ```bash
    git push origin <new version>
    ```
    *Example: git push origin v1.1.17*
