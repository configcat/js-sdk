    <strong>Welcome to the ConfigCat + Amplitude A/B Testing Sample app!</strong>
  </h1>
  <h4>
    
  </h4>
  <p>
    We would like to show a method of how to A/B testing with ConfigCat and Amplitude.
    <a href="https://configcat.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is a detailed article.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's assume we have a webshop (written in <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular</a>). 
    We would like to make our <strong>Add To Cart</strong> button on our product card more eye-catching to get visitors to click on it more times and encourage them to buy more products on our site.
    Weâ€™d like to test two product card variants: a card with a gray button and another one with a green button on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This sample shows a version of the product cards and sends tracking data to Amplitude to analyze visitor behavior.<br/>
    In <strong>app.component.ts</strong> you can init Amplitude with your API_KEY to be able to review tracking data.
  </p>
  <p>
    We show the gray button for 50% of the visitors and the green button for the other 50%.
    We have generated a visitor id for you. This your product card version based on your visitor id.
    Please click on the <strong>Add To Cart</strong> button. 
    The tracking data of the click event will be sent to Amplitude where you can analyze the A/B testing result as described in the <a href="https://configcat.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>.
