# ConfigCat React Sample App

### Start sample:
1. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
2. Run sample app
```
npm start
```
3. Open browser at `http://localhost:3000/`

## Troubleshooting
If you have trouble running the `npm start`:

Sample app dependencies conflict sometimes with the SDK root dependencies.
Make sure the `/js-sdk/node_modules` is deleted before running `npm start` on `/js-sdk/samples/react-sample`.
